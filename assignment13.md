Plans provide a plethora of services to our clients. Each plan may have its own services defined in the preconfigured scope. 

Following the implementation stage, some of your service flows might be subject to change due to an extensive system update. In particular, a user record is supplemented with additional properties described in our [API Reference](assignment2.yml). For example, users can receive the `Idle` state prior to purchasing a new plan.

The plan capacity is unlimited for each provider; providers can create as many plans as needed and then customize each of them accordingly. Each plan conforms to the corresponding state laws.
